# Weather App

This Weather App is a personal project.
It is a React-based application that leverages Redux for state management and Bootstrap for styling.
The primary functionality of the app is to display weather information based on the input city name. Users can store their favorite cities for quick access, toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit units and switch to dark mode appearance.
